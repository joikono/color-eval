# Color Evaluator
This project evaluates the accuracy of a color sample against a target color, providing precise feedback for industries where color consistency is crucial. Itâ€™s designed with use cases in mind for color production companies, where slight deviations in sample colors can lead to inaccurate batches and potential waste. By inputting the target color and a sample image, the app determines how closely the sample matches the target, offering companies a tool to ensure color accuracy and maintain high-quality production standards.
